In this excercise we're going to add Firebase to our pages.

> Create an index.html file
> Add the following to the page:
 - Bootstrap (from the CDN)
 - jQuery (from the CDN, the regular, not slim version)
 - Your firebase initialization code that you copied earlier
 - The script for firebase.database() which can be found here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup

You only need the database script, not the others.

After you've added those, insert the following into your page with HTML:

> A form with an input that takes in a "name"
> A submit button for the form
> jQuery to take out the values from the form once the form is submitted and console.log them
